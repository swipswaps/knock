# Knock

Convert ACSM files to PDF/EPUBs with one command on Linux ([and MacOS very soon](https://github.com/BentonEdmondson/knock/issues/58)).

*This software does not utilize Adobe Digital Editions nor Wine. It is completely free and open-source software written natively for Linux.*

## Installation

* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/BentonEdmondson/knock/releases). Make sure it is the correct version for your architecture (run `uname -m` to check).
* Rename the binary and make it executable.
(question: rename knock/src/knock.cpp? to what? Using mv knock.cpp knock followed by chmod + x knock failed for me on Debian Bullseye)
* Run `knock /path/to/book.acsm` to perform the conversion.
* (result -> 'bash: knock: command not found')

## Verified Book Sources

Knock should work on any ACSM file, but it has been specifically verified to work on ACSM files purchased [eBooks.com](https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/) and [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/us/en), among others.

Before buying your ebook, check if it is available for free on [Project Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/).

## The Name

The name comes from the [D&D 5e spell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Knock#content) for freeing locked items:

> ### Knock
> *2nd level transmutation*\
> **Casting Time**: 1 action\
> **Range**: 60 feet\
> **Components**: V\
> **Duration**: Instantaneous\
> **Classes**: Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard\
> Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access. A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them is unlocked. If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock, that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened and shut normally. When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.
